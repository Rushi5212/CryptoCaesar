# Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption in Python

This is a simple Python program that implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption. The user can enter a message and a shift value, and the program will display the original message, the encrypted message, and the decrypted message.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Encrypts a message using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- Decrypts the encrypted message back to its original form.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Keeps spaces and special characters unchanged.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The user enters a message and a shift value.
2. The program encrypts the message by shifting letters forward.
3. The program decrypts the message by shifting letters backward.
4. The results are displayed.

## ðŸ”§ Usage
### Run the script:
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```


## Example:

Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift value: 3

Original Message: Hello World!
Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog!
Decrypted Message: Hello World!
